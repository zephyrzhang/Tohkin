Lightbox Plus permits users to view larger versions of images from the current page and display simple slide shows, all in an overlay.

== Description ==

Lightbox Plus implements ColorBox as a lightbox image overlay tool for WordPress.  <a href="http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/">ColorBox</a> was created by Jack Moore and is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.  Lightbox Plus permits users to view larger versions of images without having to leave the current page, and is also able to display simple slide shows. The use of the dark or light background, which dims the page over which the image has been overlaid, also serves to highlight the image being viewed.  Lightbox Plus captures the image title for display in the overlay.  Lightbox Plus is able to lightbox images displayed using WordPress build in gallery. 

Lightbox Plus uses WordPress's built in jQuery library.

Read the FAQ first if you are having problems.  

= Lightbox Plus <em>NOW</em> works with WordPress' built in gallery feature. =

I'm happy to say Lightbox Plus now works with WordPress' built in gallery.  This has been the most requested feature by far.  There are few simple requirements however.  You you must set <strong>Link thumbnails to: Image File</strong> or use <code>[gallery link="file"</code> for the gallery options.  You must check <em>Use For WP Gallery</em> box under <stong>Other Lightbox Plus Settings</strong>

= IMPORTANT 1.5+ UPGRADE INFORMATION =
See the change log for information regarding this upgrading to version 1.5 of Lightbox Plus.  There are significant differences from previous versions.

= IMPORTANT 1.6.6+ UPGRADE INFORMATION =
Must have WordPress 2.8+ and the `wp_footer()` hook for Lightbox Plus to work correctly from 1.6.6 forward.  If using and older version of WordPress please continue using version 1.6.3 of Lightbox Plus.  Lightbox Plus will stop working if `wp_footer()` does not exist in the template.  See `/wp-content/themes/default/footer.php` for an example of how to place it.

= Usage =

Note that getting the caption to appear in the overlay image by using the caption options built into WordPress Lightbox Plus uses the image title which is generated by "Edit Image Title" field and not the "Edit Caption Field."  You can also manually add lightbox tags to your images using the following instructions.

1. Add a rel="lightbox[uniqueID|filename]" attribute to any link tag to activate the lightbox, include a name between square brackets in the rel attibute. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[uniqueID|filename]" title="my caption">image #1</a>

Optional: Use the title attribute if you want to show a caption.

2. If you have a set of related images that you would like to group, follow step one but additionally include a group name between square brackets in the rel attribute. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #1</a>
        <a href="images/image-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #2</a>
        <a href="images/image-3.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #3</a>

== Installation ==

1. Extract lightbox-plus.zip to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. In the admin panel under plugins activate Lightbox Plus.
3. In the admin panel under Design/Appearance click on Lightbox Plus to configure to your taste.
4. It should now be completely set up and functional

= Upgrade Issues =
* 1.5.X upgrades are not always properly removing old styles, JavaScript  and image files
 * <em>Issue Fixed:</em> Well, mostly, as of version 1.5.2 the reset button will remove the old files <em>assuming</em> the permissions are set correctly.
* 1.5.X upgrades are sometimes failing
 * <em>Workaround:</em>Remove the plugin and install a new copy.  Use the reset button afterwards to remove old setting and instantiate new ones.

= Caveats =

Flash (i.e. YouTube videos, etc.) will sit atop the Lightbox Plus display no matter what the z-index is.  This is an issue with Flash.

See <a href="http://go.adobe.com/kb/ts_tn_15523_en-us">Flash content displays on top of all DHTML layers</a> at Adobe for details.

To work around this issue you will need to add something like the following to your <code>&lt;param /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;embed&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;</code> tags:
<code>

        &lt;object&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="opaque" /&gt;&lt;embed wmode="opaque" [all other embed settings, file src etc.]&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
</code>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't get Lightbox Plus to work, why not? =

The problem may be with your Wordpress theme, mangling image display properties. Try using another theme, that doesn't interfere with posted images.  You may be lacking <code>wp_footer()</code> function in your <code>footer.php</code> of your Wordpress theme.  Look at the default theme to see how it is implemented.

Alternately you may have other plugins that conflict with Lightbox Plus. Try disabling your other plugins and see if that helps. If it does, re-enable each plugin, one at a time to see which one is causing the conflict.  Please let me know which plugin is causing the problem.

Finally, it seems that recent version of WordPress (or perhaps the plugin is causing this in some way I am not aware of) do not automatically add the link to the full size image.  You must also make sure that when you are adding an image from the WordPress media dialog control you must make sure there is a link to the image in the Link URL field.  The easiest way to get the correct link is to click on the link to image button beneath the field.  <a href="http://www.23systems.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/file.png">Visual depiction</a> of what is required when adding images in order for lightbox to function correctly.

= Lightbox Plus doesn't work properly in browser X, Y, or Z (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Explorer 6, 7, etc)? =

Yes it does, the problems are the same as above.  It has been tested in Firefox 2, 3, Safari 3, 4, Opera 9, 10, Chrome 1, 2, Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8 on Windows and Firefox 2, 3, Safari 3, 4 and Opera 9 on OS X and Firefox 2, 3, Opera 9, and Konqueror on Linux.

= Can I use this plugin and Lightview Plus, Lightbox 2 (either one), WP lightbox JS Plugin at the same time? =

No other lightbox plugins can be used, they will most likely interfere with each other as they all modify the image URLs.  Other image overlay plugins may possibly be compatible.

= Can I add my own styles and images for the overlay? =

Yes, you can easily create additional styles by adding a new folder to the CSS directory under <code>wp-content/plugins/lightbox-plus/css/</code> by duplicating and modifying any of the existing theme folders or using them as examples to create your own.

= How does Lightbox Plus differ from other Lightbox plugins for WordPress? =

Performance wise the ColorBox jQuery plugin is smaller and generally faster and has more options than most lightbox JavaScript plugins.  The regular expressions that handle the text are more robust handling a wider variety of characters and in addition it will also grab the image title from the image to use for the overlay image caption.

= Does Lightbox Plus work with WordPress' built in gallery =

Yes it does.  There are few simple requirements however.  You you must set <strong>Link thumbnails to: Image File</strong> or use <code>[gallery link="file"</code> for the gallery options.  You must check <em>Use For WP Gallery</em> box under <stong>Other Lightbox Plus Settings</strong>

= When resetting/re-initializing LBP the setting do not appear correctly when the page reloads, what gives? =

This problem is only apparent in Chrome and Opera.  It seems to works fine in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari.  There are some browser related issues and I am investigating the problem at this time.  For Chrome the settings are being saved but not displayed immediately, click on the Lightbox Plus link under appearance and you will see the current settings.  Opera for whatever reason is completely failing to save re-initialization settings, you must manually set and save them or use another browser.  And, no, it doesn't make sense since it's server side activity.

= Additional FAQs from Colorbox =

= ColorBox is positioned incorrectly or behaving strangely in Internet Explorer =

This is likely a doctype issue. ColorBox requires a valid doctype and rendering in quirks mode is not supported. Make sure you are using the full doctype declaration to insure rendering in standards mode.

This abbreviated doctype renders the document in quirks mode for Internet Explorer: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">

The doctype with URI renders in standards mode for all browsers: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

For more information, see A List Apart's <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/doctype/">primer on doctypes</a>.

= ColorBox's borders do not display in Internet Explorer =

Some of the example styles provided make use of transparent .PNG files. Alpha transparencies aren't supported by default in IE6, and can cause an undesirable 'black halo' effect in IE7 and IE8 when changing their opacity. ColorBox resolves this by using one of IE's CSS filters. You can see these at the bottom of colorbox.css. The filter src paths are relative to the HTML document (just like an IMG element), while CSS background image paths are relative to the CSS document. In the examples I provide the relative path is the same, but users often change the directory structure once they move the files over to their own host. The filter src path needs to reflect this change with the appropriate relative path or an absolute path. Here is an example that assumes the 'images' folder is in the root directory:

Original CSS with incorrect relative path: .AlphaImageLoader(src=images/internet_explorer/borderTopLeft.png

Corrected relative path: .AlphaImageLoader(src=/images/internet_explorer/borderTopLeft.png

Corrected absolute path: .AlphaImageLoader(src=http://your_domain.com/images/internet_explorer/borderTopLeft.png

= Known Problems =

* Reset re-initialize doesn't appear to work in some browsers.  It does in fact work, however, the changes are not reflect on the page.
* In some instances performance may be slow in IE - this may be due to plugin conflicts or slow JavaScript performance in IE.

* Interface updates
 * Changed admin panel to work that same way as my other plugins and thereby ease code maintainence 
 * Quick links in plugins list

 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.4 where colorbox could not be launched by triggering an element's click event through JavaScript.
 * Minor refinements.
 * Event delegation is now used for elements that ColorBox is assigned to, rather than individual click events.
 * Additional callbacks have been added to represent other stages of ColorBox's lifecycle. Available callbacks, in order of their execution: `onOpen`, `onLoad`, `onComplete`, `onCleanup`, `onClosed` These take place at the same time as the event hooks, but will be better suited than the hooks for targeting specific instances of ColorBox.

 * Focus is now returned to the calling element on closing.
 * Fixed a bug where `maxHeight` and `maxWidth` did not work for non-photo content.

 * Added `'innerWidth'` and `'innerHeight'` options to allow people to easily set the size dimensions for ColorBox, without having to anticipate the size of the borders and buttons.
 * Renamed `'scrollbars'` option to `'scrolling'` to be in keeping with the existing HTML attribute.  The option now also applies to iframes.
 * Bug fix: In Safari, positioning occassionally incorrect when using '100%' dimensions.
 * Bug fix: In IE6, the background overlay is briefly not full size when first viewing.
 * Bug fix: In Firefox, opening ColorBox causes a split second shift with a small minority of webpage layouts.
